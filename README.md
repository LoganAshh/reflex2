Impulse Tracker — Cross-platform iOS/Android MVP built with Expo (React Native), TypeScript, and NativeWind for logging habit urges/impulses. Privacy-first: stores entries locally on-device (no server-side user data). Includes bottom-tab navigation, replacement-action “shop,” stats dashboard, and analytics.
